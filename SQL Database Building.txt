Outline/code of data format for the db table
	Need a "changes" class in python that records any changes.  When loading a room, need the process to load the next room's defaults but then overwrite the cur_room details with
	any saved information from a sub-dictionary listing (only storing changes).  I also need to include a step to save the current room's state prior to leaving it.  All of this
	should be a method that's called both by saving and by changing rooms.  Maybe look for a more efficent method of saving the game state/storing the state of a room?
